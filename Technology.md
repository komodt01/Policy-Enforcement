# Technology Stack Deep Dive

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This Policy as Code enforcement system integrates multiple technologies to create an automated security governance pipeline that evaluates Infrastructure as Code against predefined security policies.

```
Developer → Git Push → GitHub Actions → Terraform Plan → OPA Evaluation → Pass/Fail → Merge/Block
```

## 🔧 Core Technologies

### 1. Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

**Purpose**: Declarative infrastructure provisioning and management
**Version**: >= 1.0
**Role in Project**: Target for policy evaluation

#### How It Works
- **Declarative Syntax**: Infrastructure defined in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
- **Plan Generation**: `terraform plan` creates execution plans showing proposed changes
- **JSON Export**: Plans converted to JSON format for programmatic analysis
- **State Management**: Tracks infrastructure state and configuration drift

#### Integration Points
```bash
# Generate plan for policy evaluation
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform show -json tfplan > plan.json
```

#### Why Terraform
- **Industry Standard**: Most widely adopted IaC tool
- **Provider Ecosystem**: Comprehensive cloud provider support
- **JSON Export**: Native support for machine-readable plan output
- **Community**: Extensive documentation and best practices

### 2. Open Policy Agent (OPA)

**Purpose**: Policy evaluation engine and decision framework
**Version**: >= 0.57.0
**Role in Project**: Core policy enforcement engine

#### How It Works
- **Policy Engine**: Evaluates input data against policy rules
- **Rego Language**: Domain-specific language for policy definition
- **JSON Input**: Processes Terraform plans in JSON format
- **Decision Output**: Returns policy violations with detailed messages

#### Architecture Components
```
Input Data (Terraform JSON) → OPA Engine → Policy Rules (Rego) → Decisions (Allow/Deny)
```

#### Policy Evaluation Process
1. **Data Loading**: OPA loads Terraform plan JSON as input
2. **Rule Evaluation**: Rego policies execute against input data
3. **Decision Generation**: Policy violations collected and formatted
4. **Result Output**: Structured violation messages returned

#### Integration Example
```bash
# Evaluate policies against Terraform plan
opa eval --data policies/ --input plan.json \
  "data.terraform.s3.deny[x]; data.terraform.tagging.deny[x]" \
  --format pretty
```

#### Why OPA
- **Policy as Code**: Treats policies as versioned, testable code
- **Language Agnostic**: Works with any JSON input source
- **Performance**: Fast evaluation suitable for CI/CD pipelines
- **Ecosystem**: Growing adoption in cloud-native security

### 3. Rego Policy Language

**Purpose**: Domain-specific language for policy definition
**Paradigm**: Declarative logic programming
**Role in Project**: Policy rule implementation

#### Language Characteristics
- **Declarative**: Describes what should be true, not how to achieve it
- **Logic-Based**: Uses logical reasoning for policy evaluation
- **JSON-Native**: Designed for structured data processing
- **Composable**: Policies can build on each other

#### Policy Structure Example
```rego
package terraform.s3

# Rule definition
deny[msg] {
    # Condition: Find S3 resources
    resource := input.planned_values.root_module.resources[_]
    resource.type == "aws_s3_bucket"
    
    # Condition: Check for public access
    resource.values.acl == "public-read"
    
    # Action: Generate violation message
    msg := sprintf("S3 bucket '%s' cannot be public", [resource.address])
}
```

#### Key Concepts
- **Rules**: Define conditions that must be met
- **Facts**: Input data being evaluated
- **Queries**: Requests for policy decisions
- **Built-ins**: Pre-defined functions for common operations

#### Why Rego
- **Expressiveness**: Complex policies in concise syntax
- **Debuggability**: Clear separation of logic and data
- **Testability**: Policies can be unit tested
- **Maintainability**: Human-readable policy definitions

### 4. GitHub Actions (CI/CD Integration)

**Purpose**: Automated workflow execution for continuous policy enforcement
**Integration**: Native GitHub repository automation
**Role in Project**: CI/CD pipeline implementation

#### Workflow Components
- **Triggers**: Pull request and push events
- **Jobs**: Sequential or parallel task execution
- **Steps**: Individual actions within jobs
- **Secrets**: Secure credential management

#### Policy Enforcement Workflow
```yaml
name: Policy as Code Enforcement
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['terraform/**']
    
jobs:
  policy-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
      - name: Setup Terraform
      - name: Setup OPA
      - name: Generate plan
      - name: Evaluate policies
      - name: Comment results
```

#### Integration Benefits
- **Automation**: Zero-touch policy evaluation
- **Feedback**: Immediate results in pull requests
- **Gating**: Prevents non-compliant deployments
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of policy decisions

#### Why GitHub Actions
- **Native Integration**: Built into GitHub workflow
- **Marketplace**: Extensive action ecosystem
- **Scalability**: Managed execution environment
- **Cost-Effective**: Generous free tier for open source

### 5. AWS (Cloud Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Target cloud platform for policy enforcement
**Services Used**: S3, RDS, EC2, VPC, Security Groups
**Role in Project**: Infrastructure platform for policy examples

#### Policy Target Areas
- **Storage Security**: S3 bucket configurations
- **Database Security**: RDS encryption and access
- **Compute Security**: EC2 instance configurations
- **Network Security**: VPC and security group rules
- **Governance**: Resource tagging and metadata

#### Common Misconfigurations Addressed
- **Public Storage**: S3 buckets with public access
- **Unencrypted Data**: RDS instances without encryption
- **Missing Governance**: Resources without required tags
- **Network Exposure**: Overly permissive security groups

#### Why AWS
- **Market Leadership**: Dominant cloud platform
- **Service Breadth**: Comprehensive service portfolio
- **Documentation**: Extensive security best practices
- **Terraform Support**: Mature provider ecosystem

## 🔄 Technology Integration Flow

### 1. Development Phase
```
Developer writes Terraform → Git commit → Pull request created
```

### 2. Automated Policy Evaluation
```
GitHub Action triggered → Terraform plan generated → JSON exported → OPA policies evaluated
```

### 3. Decision Enforcement
```
Policy violations found → Pull request blocked → Developer feedback provided
```
OR
```
No violations found → Pull request approved → Deployment allowed
```

### 4. Continuous Monitoring
```
Policies updated → All future deployments automatically evaluated against new rules
```

## ⚡ Performance Characteristics

### Evaluation Speed
- **OPA Processing**: Sub-second policy evaluation
- **Terraform Planning**: 5-30 seconds depending on complexity
